duetto Sound Lab Tasks
# TODO these are the tasks to do in the software development of the duetto SoundLab System.
# TODO tasks marked with * are ready to been implemented
# TODO those marked with - are in process and those marked with + are completed.
# TODO the tasks are divided by their complexity.

Complexity-1: No new-code activity

* Comment Widgets tools
* Comment Segmentation Window
* Comment One dim transform
* Comment Two dim transform

* Testing widget oscilogram
* Testing widget spectrogram
* Testing widget signal visualizer
* Testing widget signal detector
* Testing Widgets tools
* Testing Segmentation Window
* Testing One dim transform
* Testing Two dim transform
+ Sound Lab window and project rename to "duetto SoundLab"


-----------------------------------------------------------

Complexity-2: Small-to-medium code changes

+ Start app on maximized state
+ Change KHz to kHz on the widgets
+ Fix grids lines on widgets visibility and opacity
+ Memorize the parameters supplied in the dialogs for next use
+ Change app language by code
+ Change style by code
+ I18n add multiple translations. Add default system translation
+ Remove File up and Down actions on File menu
+ Modify order on Edit Menu
	set Undo,Redo, Copy,Cut,Paste ...
+ File Menu Change name of Save as to Save as...
+ File Menu add the save image action
	with submenus (osc image spec, and combined)
+ Remove decimal places in spectrogram settings threshold
+ Filter Hz rename to kHz and quit the labels changing it by sufix on the numeric up downs
+ Rename Save Theme action as "Save Theme as..."
+ File Menu Save selected interval as ad the ... equal to "Save as..."
+ Add Save Theme action (current theme with no needed confirmation)
+ File Menu add Save action (current signal with no needed confirmation)
+ Change the file name action to show the current signal properties
	(channels, bit depth, sr etc) and in the tooltip set a large properties display
+ Associate the .wav files to the app on opening by console
+ Check the size of strings to always show the data on the same place (best reading)

- Scroll bar implementation inside the signal visualizer widget
- Remove labels on axes (Amplitude and Frequency) Set the values (% and kHz) on the border of the axes

- Add the tool detected data on the rectangular spectrogram tool (check max and min values order)
	pointer spectrogram tool (add amp always, and diff in the selection of an interval)

* Create a workspace file or .ini with options
* Create a start window with the opening options
* Tool Bar actions group by category
* Tool Bar groups visualization by category
* Multiples files opened on tabs
* Operations provided to multiples files handling
	(close all, close all except the current, etc)
* Addition of Custom rich Dock Widgets to the duetto API and use them on the windows
* Multiple visualization of the same signal
* Add margins to the widgets for best visualization
* User manage of the height relation  between the two widgets (osc and spec) when are  both visible
* Customize the axes on the amount of ticks and the scale used (possibly by context menu) with an dynamic suggested scale
* Fix histogram bug when the histogram line values are not visible
* Set to fixed the histogram x axis
* Set labels into the histogram minimum and maximum thresholds
* Add Browse window to browse the current signal folder files (see Avisoft)
* Check spectrogram coordinate calculation
* Provide access to the last files (5)

* implement play of files even if they are not possible to play completely by the recoding
	sampling rate (make a filter)
* Add to the Sound Menu the sound devices action
	allow to select the audio device (input and output) to play/record audio signals
	must be implemented as api interface
* Add to the Sound Menu the sound format action to change the format of record signals
 (must use the properties of the selected input sound device)

* Theme improvement and completion
* Tools improvement
* Fix zoom bug. Mouse move heavy computation
* Edition operation improvement
* Resampling
* Filter
-----------------------------------------------------------

Complexity-3: Large code changes and/or multiple code files tasks

* Transformations completion
* Transformation Tools implementation
* Transformation interaction with the main window to select intervals

-----------------------------------------------------------

Complexity-4: New Code Design and Infrastructure implementation (Somoza's Revision)

* Detector widget implementation.
* Design Segmentation by polymorphic methods
* Design Elements detection and parameter measurement
* Design Classification
* Batch window implementation

-----------------------------------------------------------
